# Marketing Research Methods – Causal & Experimental Approaches

## Overview
This repository provides practical resources for **Marketing Research Methods**, covering:
- **Causal Inference**
- **Experimental & Quasi-Experimental Designs**
- **Reinforcement Learning Applications in Pricing**
- **Data Visualization & Analysis for Marketing Research**

The course is designed to help researchers apply rigorous **quantitative and experimental techniques** in marketing studies, focusing on **causality and treatment effects**.

## Key Topics Covered
### **1. Causal Inference Methods**
- **Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE)** – Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in marketing interventions.
- **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** – Evaluating policy or marketing interventions.
- **Instrumental Variables (IV)** – Addressing endogeneity issues in observational data.
- **Propensity Score Matching (PSM)** – Reducing selection bias in causal studies.

### **2. Experimental & Quasi-Experimental Designs**
- **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)** – Understanding A/B testing and marketing experiments.
- **Field & Natural Experiments** – Designing and interpreting marketing studies in real-world settings.
- **Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)** – Measuring causal impacts in marketing policies.
- **Synthetic Control Method** – Analyzing the impact of marketing interventions at scale.

### **3. Machine Learning for Causal Research**
- **Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Pricing** – Using RL models to simulate and optimize pricing strategies.
- **Causal Machine Learning** – Applying ML techniques (e.g., Double Machine Learning) to causal marketing studies.

### **4. Data Visualization & Analysis**
- **Basic Visualization for Marketing Insights** – Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.
- **Experimental Data Interpretation** – Using visualization to explain causality and treatment effects.
